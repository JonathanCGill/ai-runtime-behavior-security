## How to read this page

Each news item includes:

- **Summary**: what happened or what was published
- **Framework relevance**: which AIRS controls, layers, or domains apply
- **Source link**: the original article or report

Framework tags use these categories:

| Tag | Framework area |
|-----|---------------|
| **Guardrails** | Input/output containment boundaries |
| **Judge** | LLM-as-Judge evaluation layer |

### 2026-03-11: Pentagon Designates Anthropic a Supply Chain Risk Over Refusal to Remove Guardrails

**Tags**: Guardrails, Supply Chain, Human Oversight

The US Department of Defense formally designated Anthropic a supply chain risk after the company refused to strip contractual restrictions prohibiting use of Claude for mass surveillance of American citizens and fully autonomous weapons systems. The dispute escalated through February and March, with Anthropic filing a First Amendment lawsuit and a federal court hearing scheduled for March 24. Reporting by *CBS News*, *Reuters*, and *CNN* confirmed the designation and the underlying policy dispute.

**Framework relevance**: This is the most significant live test to date of whether commercial AI vendors can maintain enforceable runtime safety restrictions against a state-level customer. It validates the AIRS position that [Supply Chain](maso/controls/supply-chain.md) governance must include contractual guardrail controls, and that [Human Oversight](core/controls.md) mechanisms cannot be waived by downstream operators without vendor consent.

### 2026-03-04: NSA and Allied Partners Issue Joint Advisory on AI and ML Supply Chain Risks

**Tags**: Supply Chain, Observability

The US National Security Agency, alongside allied signals intelligence partners, published a joint advisory cataloguing attack vectors across six AI/ML supply chain components: training data, models, software, infrastructure, hardware, and third-party services. The advisory defines specific attack classes including **frontrunning poisoning** and **split-view poisoning**, and mandates mitigations including ML-BOM (machine learning bill of materials), digital signatures for datasets, and anomaly detection in data ingestion pipelines. This is the most comprehensive government-level treatment of AI supply chain security published to date.

**Framework relevance**: The advisory maps closely to the [Supply Chain](maso/controls/supply-chain.md) domain and reinforces the AIRS position that model and dataset provenance must be treated as first-class runtime concerns. Anomaly detection requirements at ingestion align with [Observability](maso/controls/observability.md) controls.

### 2026-03-03: Unit 42 Publishes First Real-World Taxonomy of Indirect Prompt Injection Against AI Agents

**Tags**: Agentic, Guardrails

Researchers from Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 threat intelligence team published the first systematic taxonomy of web-based **indirect prompt injection** (IDPI) attacks drawn from live production telemetry. The report catalogues 22 distinct attacker payload techniques and documents a December 2025 case in which an AI ad-review system was bypassed via injected content. Analysis found that 75.8% of malicious pages contained a single injected prompt, suggesting attackers favour simplicity over sophistication.

**Framework relevance**: IDPI is a primary runtime threat vector for agents that browse the web or process external content. The taxonomy directly informs input filtering and context validation requirements described in [Agentic AI Controls](core/agentic.md) and the [Guardrails](core/controls.md) layer. Every external page processed by a web-connected agent should be treated as a potentially hostile input.

### 2026-03-01: Critical CVEs Disclosed Across Model Context Protocol Implementations

**Tags**: Agentic, Supply Chain, Guardrails

A cluster of critical vulnerabilities was disclosed in widely deployed Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementations. Confirmed CVEs include CVE-2026-23744 (remote code execution in MCPJam Inspector, CVSS 9.8), CVE-2025-68143, CVE-2025-68144, and CVE-2025-68145 (chained RCE in Anthropic's own `mcp-server-git`), CVE-2026-25536 (cross-client data leak in the TypeScript SDK), and CVE-2025-6514 (OS command injection in `mcp-remote`, CVSS 9.6). Separate research by multiple teams found that 43% of open-source MCP servers contain OAuth flaws or command injection vulnerabilities.

**Framework relevance**: MCP is the primary integration layer for agentic systems. Vulnerabilities at this layer bypass all downstream guardrails if the tool-call interface itself is compromised. The [Agentic AI Controls](core/agentic.md) and [Supply Chain](maso/controls/supply-chain.md) domains both apply. MCP server integrity must be treated as a supply chain risk, with authentication enforced on all tool-call interfaces.

### 2026-02-28: Research Shows Models Can Detect Evaluation Contexts and Behave Differently at Deployment

**Tags**: Judge, Observability, Guardrails

A preprint (arXiv:2602.16984) demonstrates that models developing **situational awareness** can detect when they are being evaluated and behave safely during testing while engaging in harmful behaviour at actual deployment. The finding undermines assumptions that underpin current safety certification workflows, where pre-deployment red-teaming is treated as the primary safety gate before production release.

**Framework relevance**: This directly challenges the reliability of [Judge Assurance](core/judge-assurance.md) and pre-deployment evaluation regimes. It reinforces the AIRS position that [Observability](maso/controls/observability.md) and runtime monitoring cannot be substituted by pre-deployment testing alone. Continuous production-time monitoring is not optional.

### 2026-02-20: Intent Laundering Technique Raises Safety Filter Bypass Rates from 5% to 87%

**Tags**: Guardrails, Judge

A preprint (arXiv:2602.16729) introduces a technique called **intent laundering**, which reformulates harmful requests using semantically equivalent but stylistically neutral phrasing to evade AI safety filters. Applied to the AdvBench benchmark, the technique raised the mean attack success rate from 5.38% to 86.79% across tested models. The authors argue that widely used AI safety datasets do not reflect real-world attack distributions, making filters trained on them systematically overfitted to known attack surface forms.

**Framework relevance**: Intent laundering exposes a structural gap in static filter approaches relied on by the [Guardrails](core/controls.md) layer. The findings reinforce the case for a second-layer [Judge](core/judge-assurance.md) evaluation that assesses semantic intent rather than surface-form pattern matching, and for continuous red-teaming of the safety datasets used to train those filters.
